# ReLeSeg-Retinal-Lesions-Segmentation
# Abstract
ReLesSeg represents the software tools for automatic processing of retinal lesions from retinal images. To run this software, use the file ReLesSeg.exe. After running this file, an user is required to select a retinal image for the analysis. We added the folder Retinal_Images, which contain together 20 retinal images from the systems Clarity RetCam 3 and Icon PHOENIX. Consequently, a pre-processed selected retinal image will appears. Here an user is supposed to specify the center of initial contour for the further segmentation. After this step, the segmentation process is being processed, where in predefined number of iterations the active contour adopts the morphological features of the selected retinal lesion. As soon as the segmentation process is over, user will receive the following results:

Graphical results:
•    Native retinal image with the segmentation curve
•    Comparison of native retinal image with segmentation result
•    Histogram of intensity distribution of the selected retinal lesion from the segmentation model

Stored Results:
•    Binary model of retinal lesion
•    Native image
•    Results of native and pre-processed images, binary segmentation model, and extracted features for lesion quantification.
